In Computer science, Artificial Intel, sometimes called machine Intel, is Intel demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural Intel displayed by Humans and animals. The term "Artificial Intel" is often used to describe machines or Computers that mimic "cognitive" functions that Humans associate with the Human mind, such as "Studying" and "Issue solving".
